# Cutscenes
  
[WIP] Cutscenes system for TrinityCore 3.3.5

Allows to perform scripted actions in protected game environment **involving creatures, gameobjects, players and plyer groups**, temporarily taking control of all actors and their actions.

Demo can be found in [Discussions](https://github.com/trickerer/Cutscenes/discussions/2)
